# Passphrase Generator
A simple, single-page web application to generate secure, random passphrases. It provides both an on-page generator and a convenient bookmarklet that copies a new passphrase to your clipboard on any website.  
  
This tool is built with vanilla JavaScript and contains no external dependencies beyond [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling, ensuring transparency and security. 
  
All passphrase generation happens 100% client-side.  

## Live Demo  
You can use the live version of this tool hosted on GitHub Pages:  
[https://danlibbo.github.io/passphraseGenerator/](https://danlibbo.github.io/passphraseGenerator/)

## Features
* **On-Page Generator**: Instantly create and copy a new passphrase directly from the webpage.  
* **Bookmarklet**: Add the generator to your browser's bookmarks/favourites bar for use on any webpage.  
* **High Entropy**: Generates passphrases from large, curated, and SFW (safe-for-work) word lists.  
* **Secure & Transparent**: 100% client-side vanilla JavaScript. No data is ever sent to any server.  
* **Informative UI**: The page explains the generation logic and shows the full, readable source code.

## How to Use
There are two ways to use this tool.
1. **On-Page Generator**
    1. Visit [the live demo page](https://danlibbo.github.io/passphraseGenerator/).  
    2. Click the "Generate Passphrase" button.  
    3. Click the copy icon to copy the new passphrase to your clipboard.  
2. **The Bookmarklet** (Recommended)  
    1. This is the most powerful feature. It lets you generate a passphrase on any website (e.g., a new account sign-up form) without having to open a new tab.  
    2. Visit [the live demo page](https://danlibbo.github.io/passphraseGenerator/).  
    3. Find the green button labelled "Drag to Bookmarks â†’".  
    4. Click and drag this button up to your browser's bookmarks bar (also called the "favourites bar").
       
That's it! Now, when you are on any website and need a new password, just click that bookmark. A new passphrase will be instantly generated and copied to your clipboard.

## Passphrase Structure
Each passphrase follows a consistent, random format:  
`[Descriptor] + [Punctuation 1] + [Verb] + [Puncutation 2] + [Noun] + [Number]`  
  
Example: `Quickly#Driving.List42`  
  
**Capitalisation**: The first letter of each word is randomly capitalised (or lowercased). The logic ensures that at least one of the three words will be capitalised.  

**Word Lists**: The generator pulls from three curated, SFW lists:  
  * 147 Descriptors (adjectives/adverbs)  
  * 173 Verbs (present/past participles)  
  * 100 Nouns
  
**Punctuation**: A random choice from `!, #, $, %, &, *, +, -`  

**Number**: A random two-digit number from 10 to 99.
